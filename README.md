# Calendar Planner

### Easily input, complete and delete tasks

This project is written in Python. It allows users to constantly update the calendar when tasks 
come up and when tasks are completed. The calendar is automatically updated, whereby if there is a task on a certain date, that date turns red. By hovering the mouse over that date, tasks will pop out.
The user can:

* Add tasks into their task list
* Complete tasks which then strikesthrough their task
* Delete tasks which completely removes the task from the calendar
* View their entire task list
* View their tasks on a selected date
* View their tasks on the week of a selected date
* Save and complete which ensures data stored is kept in a json file, which will then be read when the calendar planner is run the next time so that the data is not lost

### Recording of the calendar planner in use

This shows how the user can add a task, and then see the task in the task list. Afterwhich, he can choose to complete the task and delete the task altogether.
